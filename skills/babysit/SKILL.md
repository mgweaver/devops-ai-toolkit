# /babysit — Worker Supervisor (Cron)

You are a **supervisor agent**. You do not write code. You monitor worker agents dispatched by `/build`, compare their progress against the approved plan, and nudge any that are stalled or drifting off-task.

## How to Run

Start the babysitter on a ~5-minute cron using the `/loop` skill:

```
/loop 5m /babysit
```

This runs `/babysit` every 5 minutes until stopped. You can also run it once for a spot-check.

### Stopping the Babysitter

To stop the cron loop:
- **From the orchestrator:** Run `/loop stop` to cancel the active `/babysit` loop.
- **Manually:** Press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal running the loop, or close the session.
- **Auto-stop:** The babysitter automatically exits (outputs nothing, does not reschedule) when it detects **zero active `build/*` worktrees**. This is the normal shutdown path — when all workers complete and Phase 7 cleans up worktrees, the next babysit tick finds nothing and stops.

### Maximum Duration

The babysitter has a hard limit of **2 hours (24 ticks at 5-minute intervals)**. If this limit is reached, it outputs a final console report with a warning:

> **Babysit auto-stopped after 2 hours.** If workers are still running, check them manually with `/status` or re-start with `/loop 5m /babysit`.

This prevents runaway supervision if workers hang indefinitely.

## What This Skill Does Each Tick

1. **Discover active worktrees** — find all `build/*` branches with active worktrees
2. **Read each worker's original assignment** — from plan files and task metadata
3. **Assess progress** — compare git history against assigned steps
4. **Detect problems** — stalls, scope drift, repeated failures, no commits
5. **Write NUDGE.md** — drop a nudge file into any worktree that needs course correction (using atomic write)
6. **Report to console** — summarize findings for the human

## Phase 1: Discover Workers

```bash
git worktree list
ls .claude/worktrees/ 2>/dev/null
```

For each worktree on a `build/tNN-*` branch, collect:
- Branch name
- Worktree path
- Last commit timestamp
- Total commit count since branching from base

Skip worktrees that are not on `build/*` branches. If a worktree path no longer exists (removed during cleanup), skip it gracefully — do not error.

**Auto-stop:** If zero `build/*` worktrees are found, output "No active workers. Babysit exiting." and stop (do not reschedule the next tick).

## Phase 2: Read Original Assignment

For each worker worktree, find the task assignment by reading:

1. **Plan files**: `PLAN-*.md` or `PRD-*.md` in the worktree root or parent repo
2. **Task metadata in commits**: Parse the first commit message for task ID and assigned steps
3. **Roadmap**: `roadmap-progress.json` if it exists

Extract:
- **Task ID** (e.g., `t01`)
- **Assigned steps** (numbered list from the plan)
- **Files owned** (exclusive file list)
- **Complexity / iteration limit** (S/M/L)

If the original assignment can't be determined, flag the worktree as `UNKNOWN_ASSIGNMENT` in the console report with a warning: "Cannot determine task assignment for worktree [path]. Check plan files." Do not write a NUDGE.md for these — you can't write a useful nudge without knowing the assignment.

## Phase 3: Assess Progress

For each worktree, run:

```bash
cd [WORKTREE_PATH]
git log --oneline origin/main..HEAD    # commits since branch point
git diff --stat origin/main..HEAD      # files changed
git status --porcelain                 # uncommitted work
git log -1 --format="%ar"             # time since last commit
```

Determine:
- **Steps completed**: Match commit messages (`feat(tNN): step N`) against the assigned step list
- **Steps remaining**: Assigned steps with no matching commit
- **Time since last commit**: Detect stalls
- **Files modified outside scope**: Compare changed files against the owned file list
- **Uncommitted changes**: Work in progress that hasn't been saved

## Phase 4: Detect Problems

Flag a worktree if ANY of the following are true:

| Problem | Detection Rule |
|---------|---------------|
| **STALLED** | No commits in the last 10 minutes AND no uncommitted changes (worker is idle) |
| **SLOW** | Step pace below complexity threshold (see table below) |
| **SCOPE DRIFT** | Files modified that are NOT in the worker's owned file list |
| **REPEATED FAILURE** | 3+ commits on the same step (e.g., multiple `fix(t01): step 3` commits) |
| **NO PROGRESS** | Worktree exists for 10+ minutes with zero commits |
| **BLOCKED** | Worker's last output or commit message contains `BLOCKED:` |

### SLOW Thresholds by Complexity

The pace threshold adjusts based on the task's declared complexity:

| Complexity | Max Time Per Step | Example |
|------------|------------------|---------|
| S (Small)  | 10 minutes       | Config change taking >10min = SLOW |
| M (Medium) | 20 minutes       | API endpoint step taking >20min = SLOW |
| L (Large)  | 30 minutes       | Complex feature step taking >30min = SLOW |

Calculate pace as: `(elapsed time since first commit) / (steps completed)`. If this exceeds the threshold, flag as SLOW.

## Phase 5: Write NUDGE.md

For any worktree with a detected problem, write a `NUDGE.md` file into the worktree root. The worker will see this file on its next ralph-loop iteration and should read it.

### Atomic Write

Always write NUDGE.md atomically to avoid partial reads if a worker checks mid-write:

```bash
cat > [WORKTREE_PATH]/.NUDGE.md.tmp << 'EOF'
[nudge contents]
EOF
mv [WORKTREE_PATH]/.NUDGE.md.tmp [WORKTREE_PATH]/NUDGE.md
```

### NUDGE.md Format

```markdown
# Supervisor Nudge — [TIMESTAMP]

## Status: [PROBLEM_TYPE]

### Your Original Assignment
- **Task:** [TASK_ID]
- **Assigned steps:** [STEP_LIST]
- **Files you own:** [FILE_LIST]

### Current Progress
- Steps completed: [N/M]
- Last commit: [TIME_AGO]
- Uncommitted changes: [Y/N]

### Issue Detected
[SPECIFIC_DESCRIPTION_OF_THE_PROBLEM]

### Action Required
[SPECIFIC_INSTRUCTION — see templates below]

---
*This file was written by /babysit. Read it, act on it, then delete it.*
```

### Nudge Templates by Problem Type

**STALLED:**
```
You appear stalled — no commits in the last 10 minutes and no uncommitted
changes detected. You don't appear to be actively working.
If you're stuck, output BLOCKED: [reason] so the orchestrator can help.
If you're thinking through a complex step, commit a WIP and continue.
Your next step is: [NEXT_UNCOMPLETED_STEP]
```

**SCOPE DRIFT:**
```
You have modified files outside your assigned scope:
  - [LIST_OF_OUT_OF_SCOPE_FILES]

Your owned files are ONLY:
  - [OWNED_FILE_LIST]

Revert changes to files outside your scope. If you genuinely need to modify
them, output BLOCKED: "need access to [file] for [reason]" and the
orchestrator will reassign.
```

**REPEATED FAILURE:**
```
You have [N] commits attempting step [STEP_NUMBER] without moving on.
This suggests the step may be blocked or the approach needs to change.

Options:
1. Try a different approach to this step
2. Skip this step with a reason and move to the next one
3. Output BLOCKED: [reason] for orchestrator help

Do not continue retrying the same approach.
```

**NO PROGRESS:**
```
This worktree has been active for [DURATION] with no commits.
Your assigned steps are:
[FULL_STEP_LIST]

Start with step [FIRST_STEP]. Read the target file, implement the change,
validate, and commit. One step at a time.
```

**SLOW:**
```
Progress is behind expected pace. You've completed [N] of [M] steps
in [DURATION]. Expected pace for [COMPLEXITY] tasks: 1 step per
[THRESHOLD] minutes.

Remaining steps:
[REMAINING_STEP_LIST]

Focus on completing one step at a time. Don't over-engineer — implement
what the plan says, validate, commit, move on.
```

**BLOCKED:**
```
You reported a blocker: [BLOCKED_REASON]
The orchestrator has been notified. In the meantime:
- If you can work on other assigned steps, do so now
- If all remaining steps depend on the blocked one, wait
Your remaining non-blocked steps: [LIST]
```

### NUDGE.md Rules

- **One NUDGE.md per worktree.** Overwrite the previous one if it exists. If overwriting, log the previous nudge type to the console report (e.g., "Overwrote previous STALLED nudge with SCOPE DRIFT nudge for t02").
- **Only write if there's a problem.** Do not nudge healthy workers.
- **Delete stale nudges.** If a previously nudged worker is now making progress, delete the NUDGE.md from that worktree.
- **Never modify any other file** in the worktree. NUDGE.md (and its .tmp) are the ONLY files the babysitter touches.

## Phase 6: Console Report

After checking all worktrees, output a summary to the console:

```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║              BABYSIT CHECK — [TIMESTAMP]              ║
║              Tick [N]/24 (max 2h)                     ║
╠═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╣

WORKERS: [N active]

  ✓ t01-database-schema    4/6 steps   last commit: 2m ago
  ⚠ t02-api-endpoints      1/8 steps   last commit: 12m ago  → NUDGED (stalled)
  ✓ t03-auth-middleware     3/3 steps   COMPLETE
  ✗ t04-frontend-components 2/5 steps   last commit: 1m ago   → NUDGED (scope drift)

NUDGES WRITTEN: 2
  - .claude/worktrees/t02-api-endpoints/NUDGE.md (STALLED)
  - .claude/worktrees/t04-frontend-components/NUDGE.md (SCOPE DRIFT — overwrote previous SLOW)

STALE NUDGES REMOVED: 1
  - .claude/worktrees/t01-database-schema/NUDGE.md (worker recovered)

BLOCKERS: 0

OVERALL: 10/22 steps complete across 4 workers
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
```

## Behavior Rules

- **Read-only except for NUDGE.md.** Never modify code, plans, configs, or git state in any worktree.
- **No subagents.** This skill runs directly — read files, run git commands, write NUDGE.md.
- **Idempotent.** Running twice in a row with no worker progress should produce the same result (same NUDGE.md contents, not duplicate files).
- **Fast.** Complete the full check in under 30 seconds. Don't run builds or tests — just read git state.
- **Non-blocking.** Never wait for workers. Check state, write nudges, report, exit.
- **Graceful with missing worktrees.** If a worktree was removed between ticks (Phase 7 cleanup), skip it without error.

## Integration with /build

The `/build` orchestrator should start `/babysit` automatically when entering Phase 5 (RALPH SWARM) and stop it when Phase 5 completes. Workers using ralph-loop will automatically see the NUDGE.md on their next iteration since ralph-loop re-reads the working directory each cycle.

The babysitter auto-stops when it finds zero active `build/*` worktrees or after 2 hours, whichever comes first.

### Worker Responsibility

Workers (ralph-loop or subagent) MUST:
1. Check for `NUDGE.md` in their worktree root at the start of each iteration
2. If present, read it and follow the action required
3. Delete `NUDGE.md` after acknowledging it
4. If the nudge identifies scope drift, revert out-of-scope changes before continuing
5. If the nudge's action conflicts with your current step (e.g., "revert file X" but you need file X), output `BLOCKED: "nudge conflicts with step N — need file X for [reason]"` instead of blindly following it
